Greetings! My name is Tonye Erekosima, and I am a high school sophomore from Maryland with a passion for cybersecurity and business.

I started this website to share my accomplishments, experiences, and writeups with others. This website will primarily focus on cyber-related topics, and some posts may also be generally related to high school.

- I would like to major in either cybersecurity or computer science + business.
- I would like to serve my fellow Americans by creating a great product. 
- I am involved in student leadership and advocacy on the county and state level
- I compete in CyberPatriot and CTF competitions and won 1st Place in LBC2, a statewide cybersecurity competition. 
- I play football and work on my fitness and my body each day. 

One of my guiding principles is to be completely confident in myself and through God. My favorite Bible verse is Phillipians 4:13

> "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."

Feel free to contact me via email at `tboyereks@gmail.com` if you want to discuss cybersecurity, public policy, high school, or anything related to me or this website. I hope that you enjoyed reading this, and that you learned something from it. Have a good day!
